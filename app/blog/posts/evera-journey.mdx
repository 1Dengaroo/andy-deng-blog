---

Since **July 2024**, I have been working remotely as a **Contract Software Engineer** at **Evera**, where I’m leading the migration of our e-commerce platform from a **Rails and React** stack to a more modern, scalable system using **Next.js**, **Medusa**, and **Node.js**. This migration has allowed me to modernize the platform and improve its overall performance, setting the foundation for future growth.

## Rebuilding Core Features

As part of this migration, I’ve been focused on **rebuilding core features** that are critical to the platform’s functionality. These features include **product management**, **payments**, and **order processing**, all of which are being re-engineered using **Medusa’s headless commerce framework**. This transition is enabling us to create a more flexible and scalable backend, improving both developer efficiency and user experience.

## The Challenge of Migration

Migrating an entire e-commerce platform while ensuring no downtime is a challenging process. It has required careful planning and a deep understanding of the existing architecture. Each phase of the migration has been strategically executed, ensuring that critical services like payments and order processing remain fully operational during the transition.

## What I’m Learning

This experience has provided me with deeper knowledge of **headless commerce systems** and the flexibility that platforms like **Medusa** offer. I’ve also sharpened my skills in **Next.js** and **Node.js**, applying them to build more efficient, scalable solutions.

## Conclusion

My work at **Evera** continues to be an exciting challenge, as I lead this critical migration to modern technologies. This experience is not only enhancing my technical skill set but also shaping my ability to manage complex projects in fast-paced environments, contributing to the growth and success of the platform.
